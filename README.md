# Glass Classification using unsupervised learning

## Density Graph Visualization

The density graphs for each feature and the correlation matrix are generated. Mg feature density graph as an example
is shown below. Interpreting the correlation matrix with the help of the density graphs, we can have the following
conclusions and evidence supporting such conclusions. First of all, the 0.81 correlation
coefficient at the first column implies that RI has a fairly strong positive relationship with Ca.
This is why the density graphs of Ca and RI have the similar tendency. Then the values from the
second and the third column implies that Na, Mg, and Al have weak relationships with others.
The -0.55 correlation coefficient at the fifth column implies that Si has a moderate negative
relationship with RI. Therefore, the correlation matrix can tell us the relationship between each
feature.
